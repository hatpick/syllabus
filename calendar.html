				<h2>Special Circumstances</h2>
				<p>Any accommodations you need regarding the schedule need to be set up by Wednesday of week 2. After that time, no exceptions will be made except for emergency situations at the instructor's discretion.</p>
				<h2>Final Exam</h2>
				<h3>Scheduling</h3>
				<p>You <strong>must schedule a time to take the final exam, with a proctor, at least 2 weeks before the exam.</strong> If you do not do this you risk not being able to take the final and losing a very significant portion of your grade.</p>
				<p>The exam window runs from 12:00am Pacific Time on the Sunday beginning exam week through 11:59pm Wednesday of exam week. The exam must be started and finished within that window.</p>
				<h3>ProctorU</h3>
				<p>I highly recommend you do not use ProctorU. Students have had their exams canceled due to ProctorU maintenance. <strong>If you choose to use them there is more of a burden on you should something go wrong. So be cautious and document any irregularities well.</strong> I strongly suggest you take it at a proctoring center if possible. They typically have redundant systems and should an issue are very good about contacting me. This has not been the case with Proctor U.<p>
